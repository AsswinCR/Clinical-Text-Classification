# Clinical-Text-Classification
Natural Language Processing__

In this project we have implemented classification for clinical text using sequence and non-sequence modeling, In sequence modeling, LSTM and Transformers models use word embedding and positional word embedding respectively and in non-sequence modeling, ML 
models such as Logistic regression, multi-class classifier with knn and the random forest is 
used.
